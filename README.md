# SCPSL Gamemodes
Made by Galaxy119
## Description
A collection of scripted gamemodes for running on SCP Secret Laboratory Servers, using the EXILED Plugin framework.
Each Gamemode is, in and of itself, it's own self-contained plugin, with no extra dependencies, and should be installed as normal plugins **UNLESS YOU INTEND ON USING GAMEMODE MANAGER TO MANAGE GAMEMODES. GMM IS REQUIRED IF YOU WANT TO USE THE QUEUE SYSTEM. REFER TO IT'S DOCUMENTATION BELOW FOR INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO SET IT UP TO MANAGE GAMEMODE PLUGINS, THE INSTALL PROCESS FOR THE GAMEMODES IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WHEN USING GMM!! I CAN AND WILL LAUGH AT YOU IF YOU FUCK UP SOMETHING BASIC THAT WAS EXPLAINED IN THE READMEs!!**
